This script has been created to bypass the fact that Squid3 proxy isn't compiled with SSL support and is an absolute nightmare to compile in Debian right now.\r\n\r\nThis setup has been created to quickly install a proxy on small lowendbox VPS mostly for \"google rank analysis\" / scraping.\r\n\r\n**MANUAL :**\r\n\r\nDownload, make executable and run with these lines :\r\n\r\n    >wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/barankilic/3proxy/master/3proxyinstaller.sh\r\n    >chmod +x 3proxyinstaller.sh\r\n    >./3proxyinstaller.sh\r\n\r\nAfter install : CHANGE THE BLOODY DEFAULT USERNAME AND PASSWORD !!!\r\n\r\n    >nano /etc/3proxy/.proxyauth\r\n\r\nExample change line inside .proxyauth\r\n\r\n    johndoe:CL:johndoepassword123\r\n\r\nYou can also change the port, default is 3128\r\n\r\n    >nano /etc/3proxy/3proxy.cfg\r\n    \r\n\r\nOnce you've change the username / password you can start the proxy \r\n(or reboot the VPS as 3proxy has been added to the init scripts and will autostart)\r\n\r\n    >/etc/init.d/3proxyinit start\r\n\r\n**Script tested on November 5, 2015 on the following fresh VPS install distros :**\r\n\r\n* Debian 8 64bit\r\n* Scaleway C1 Debian Jessie Image\r\n\r\n**Script will run on :**\r\n* Debian 6 32bits\r\n* Debian 7 32bits\r\n* Ubuntu 12.10 32bits\r\n* Ubuntu 12.04 32bits\r\n","google":"UA-70104652-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
